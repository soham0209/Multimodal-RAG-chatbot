1,1,1,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth saw a significant decline, reversing nearly a decade of progress within two years. It dropped by 0.7 years to 72.5 years in 2020, returning to 2016 levels, and then decreased by an additional 1.1 years to 71.4 years in 2021, which brought it back to 2012 levels.",Figure 1.1
2,1,2,"The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region were the hardest hit by the pandemic, experiencing a 3.0-year drop in life expectancy and a 2.5-year drop in healthy life expectancy (HALE) between 2019 and 2021.",Figure 1.2
3,1,3,"Globally, the disease burden shifted from a pre-pandemic trend of increasing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to a rise in communicable diseases during 2020 and 2021, reaching levels similar to 2012 or 2005 (Fig. 1.4). While regions like the African and Western Pacific Regions saw little change, the European Region experienced an abrupt shift where the share of NCD deaths dropped from 89.6% in 2019 to 75.9% in 2021, and communicable diseases nearly quadrupled their share (Fig. 1.5). Similar shifts were observed in other WHO regions and in upper-middle and high-income countries.",Figure 2.16
4,2,1,"In 2021, the top causes of death globally included ischaemic heart disease, COVID-19, and stroke. COVID-19 emerged as the second leading cause of death globally in 2021, claiming 8.8 million lives (1).

As shown in Figure 1.7, the top 10 causes of death globally in 2021 were:
1. Ischaemic heart disease
2. COVID-19
3. Stroke
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
5. Lower respiratory infections
6. Diabetes mellitus
7. Alzheimer disease and other dementias
8. Cirrhosis of the liver
9. Diarrhoeal diseases
10. Tuberculosis (1)",Figure 1.7
5,2,2,"Yes, COVID-19 ranked differently across various WHO regions. In 2020 and 2021, it was among the top five causes of death in all but two regions: the African and Western Pacific regions. Specifically, it was the leading cause of death in the Region of the Americas in both years, in the South-East Asia Region in 2021, and the second largest cause of death in the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions in both years. In the African Region, COVID-19 moved from 12th to sixth in 2021, while in the Western Pacific Region, it remained outside the top 10, rising from 50th in 2020 to 19th in 2021 (1).",Figure 1.8
6,2,3,"Substantial progress has been made in reducing maternal and child mortality since 2000. Global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) dropped by a third from 339 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 227 in 2015, although progress stagnated between 2016 and 2020, with 287,000 women dying from maternal causes in 2020 (3). Meanwhile, the total number of deaths among children under 5 years of age declined by 51%, from 9.9 million in 2000 to 4.9 million in 2022, with the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) decreasing from 76 to 37 deaths per 1000 live births during the same period (4).",Figure 1.1
7,3,1,"Globally, the world is moving in the right direction concerning HIV prevention, with new HIV infections reduced by 54% in 2022 compared to 2000, and the global HIV incidence rate declining by 32% since 2015. However, progress varies by region, and the world is still far from reaching the targets set for 2025 and 2030, which aim for an incidence rate of 0.05 and 0.025 respectively.",Figure 2.1
8,3,2,"In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people globally developed Tuberculosis (TB), with a global incidence rate of 133 per 100,000 population. This rate showed increases in 2021 and 2022, reverting to 2019 levels and falling behind the WHO End TB strategy's 2025 milestone of a 50% reduction from the 2015 baseline.

Regarding Malaria, there were an estimated 249 million cases and 631,000 deaths in 2022 across 85 endemic countries. The global malaria incidence rate was 58.4 in 2022, which is significantly higher than the expected rate of 26.2 needed to achieve the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) targets. The WHO African Region continues to bear the heaviest burden, accounting for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of deaths in 2022. Children under five remain particularly vulnerable. To combat this, WHO recommended the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in 2021 and the R21-Matrix-M vaccine in 2023, with wide implementation expected to save tens of thousands of lives annually.",Figure 2.8
9,3,3,"Yes, there are indeed success stories in disease elimination.

In 2023, Egypt became the first country to achieve ""gold tier"" status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C, fulfilling WHO targets for reduced incidence and mortality before 2030 through a massive nationwide screening and treatment program. Additionally, Bangladesh successfully eliminated visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis as public health problems in the same year, following comprehensive national and regional initiatives.",Figure 2.3
10,4,1,"Globally, the age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older was estimated at 20.9% in 2022, representing a 21% relative decline from 26.4% in 2010. While this progress is encouraging, the world is projected to achieve a 25% relative reduction by 2025, falling short of the 30% reduction target.

For alcohol, the total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) globally in 2019 was 5.5 litres, a 4.5% decline from 5.7 litres in 2010, but still higher than the 2000 level of 5.1 litres. This pace of decline indicates that acceleration is needed to meet global targets of at least 10% reduction by 2025 and 20% by 2030. Preliminary global estimates suggest total APC in 2020 was 4.9 litres, with the COVID-19 pandemic having an apparent impact on consumption.",Figure 2.7
11,4,2,"Yes, people are getting better access to clean water and sanitation. Between 2000 and 2022, approximately 2.1 billion people gained access to safely managed drinking water and 2.5 billion gained access to safely managed sanitation. Globally, the coverage of safely managed drinking water increased from 69% in 2015 to 73% in 2022, and safely managed sanitation increased from 49% to 57% during the same period.",Figure 2.9
12,4,3,"Countries' preparedness for health emergencies is measured by the International Health Regulations (IHR) States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) tool, which assesses 15 IHR capacities for detecting, assessing, notifying, reporting, and responding to public health risks. Globally, the top challenges identified are policy, legal, and normative instruments to implement IHR, chemical events, radiation emergencies, and human resources, while strengths include laboratory, surveillance, health emergency management, and health services provision. Regional performance varies, with the African Region generally having the lowest scores for most capacities, except for zoonotic diseases.",Figure 2.5
13,5,1,"Government spending continues to constitute the largest share of health financing, with the proportion of total government spending on health by World Bank income group between 2000 and 2021 detailed in Figure 2.16.",Figure 2.16
14,5,2,"Yes, people are facing financial hardship from health costs, with the latest data indicating that 2 billion people suffer financial hardship due to impoverishing or catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending. The global proportion of the population experiencing catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending reached 13.5% in 2019, affecting over 1 billion people.",Figure 2.17
